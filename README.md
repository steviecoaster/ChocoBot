# ChocoBot - The PoshBot Chocolatey Plugin

## :construction: THIS PROJECT IS IN DEVELOPMENT. It is functionally useless at the minute. This README will be updated once something useful is available.

Do you use Slack? Teams? Discord? Do you partake in [ChatOps](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/what-is-chatops/)? If you've answered yes, or you'd _like_ to do those things, this is another tool in your toolbelt!

This plug-in allows you to execute choco commands on target systems directly from your enterprise messaging platform!

## Cool things you can do

- Install Chocolatey Packages
- Uninstall Chocolatey Packages
- Upgrade Chocolatey Packages
- List available Chocolatey Packages for installation
- Configure Chocolatey Sources

## Help

Help is available via a chat message! For example, for help with installing packages, execute the following:

```powershell
!help choco:install
```

Online help is also available in the docs [here](https://github.com/steviecoaster/ChocoBot/blob/main/Help).
